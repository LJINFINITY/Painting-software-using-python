This is a one of the First actual projects I've done with python, although there is alot of improvment to be made,
I am quiet satisfied with the result as of now.
The features include:
  . A working Canvas where you can draw stuff.
  . Basic tools like brush, eraser, circle, rectangle and fill.
  . A completely working Undo & Redo system.
  . An image export system. (exports the whole canvas as .png or .jpg)

That's bout it! Thank you!
