This is a one of the First actual porjects I've done with python, althought there is alot of improvment to me made,
I am quiet satisfied with the result as of now.
The features include:
  . A working Canvas where your can draw stuff.
  . Basic tools like brush, eraser, circle, rectangle and fill.
  . A completely working Undo & Redo system.
  . An image export system. (exports the whole canvas as .png or .jpg)

That's bout it! Thank you!
